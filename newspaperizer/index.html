        <h1>The President Gets a Daily Briefing. Why Can't You?</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Wake up to your newsletters printed and ready to read. No screens, no distractions, just your morning briefing.</p>

        <h2>You Deserve Better Than Reading From Your Phone</h2>
        <p>CEOs read reports on paper. Judges read cases on paper. Serious people who need to think clearly don't stare at glowing rectangles.</p>
        <p><strong>The Newspaperizer brings that to your newsletters.</strong></p>
        <p>Set it up once. Every morning at 7 AM, your favorite Substack newsletters print automatically.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <div class="feature-list">
            <div class="feature">
                <strong>1. Add your Substacks</strong>
                <p>Tell it which newsletters you want</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <strong>2. Set your time</strong>
                <p>Pick when you want them printed (default: 7 AM)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <strong>3. Forget about it</strong>
                <p>Wake up to printed newsletters every morning</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Newspaperizer checks your favorite writers, finds new posts from yesterday, and prints them while you sleep.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Paper?</h2>
        <p><strong>You think better on paper.</strong> Studies show people comprehend more, remember longer, and focus better when reading physical text.</p>
        <p><strong>No distractions.</strong> No tabs, no notifications, no "just checking Twitter real quick."</p>
        <p><strong>It feels right.</strong> There's a reason executives still get printed briefings. There's a reason contracts are signed on paper. Physical matters.</p>

                    <p>My failed experiment with a flip phone led me down a rabbit hole about addiction, social norms, and why I spent 8 hours on Twitter last Thursday.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I recently graduated from college and I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life. This website is where I think out loud about things that interest me: how technology changes behavior, what makes good art, and why we do the things we do.</p>
                <p>I believe in narrowing affordances, embodying the Rat Park, and occasionally putting down my phone.</p>
